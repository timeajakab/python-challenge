# python-challenge Module 3

In this assignment, you'll use the concepts you've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote
